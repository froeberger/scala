# scala
A repository for my own NON-EQUAL-TEMPERAMENT and microtonal tunings and the Scala Tuning Files ( .scl )  that reflect them which I use in the workflow of music production with modern, digital audio workstations like Bitwig Studio or Ableton Live.  


The .kbm files are the second REQUISITE to using the scala tuning file, unless your DAW allows you to select the key, as in Bitwig Studio.  Even so, use the .kbm if you use a plugin within Bitwig Studio.


These files are released to the world under a 'free not fee' open-source license of my own design which states that all are free to use and distribute these files as long as:


    1.  They are not modified whatsoever.
    
    2.  They are not sold, commercialized, or used in any manner which results in financial gain.  
    
    
Enjoy!
